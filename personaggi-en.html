        <h1>Main Characters</h1>

<div class="character-block">
    <h2>Valerio Rufo Celtico</h2>
    <p>Legatus of the XII Fulminata Legion, an unyielding commander and ruthless strategist. Born in Lugdunum into a senatorial family of Romanized Gallic origins, he was raised with one goal: to serve Rome above all else. Obsessed with duty, he carries the weight of war and his choices on his shoulders. Tall, blond, with grey eyes—he is a man forged by command and discipline.</p>
</div>

<div class="character-block">
    <h2>Giulio Aquila</h2>
    <p>A young optio in search of validation and certainty, torn between loyalty to Rome and the instinct to survive. From a middle-class family in Ostia, he is rigid and stoic like a typical Roman soldier. Black hair, piercing eyes, athletic build—he bears the marks of his transformation in both body and soul.</p>
</div>

<div class="character-block">
    <h2>Sairika</h2>
    <p>Tigurini warrior, proud and deadly, sworn enemy of Rome. Descendant of an ancient warrior lineage, she lost everything to Roman expansion and now lives for vengeance. Flame-red hair, green eyes, sculpted body, and a tattooed right arm adorned with tribal symbols and serpents. She does not bend. She does not surrender.</p>
</div>

<div class="character-block">
    <h2>Aurelia Cassia</h2>
    <p>Noblewoman and wife of Valerio, cunning and manipulative. She belongs to one of Rome’s most powerful families, raised amidst intrigue and ambition. Her true battlefield is power over men, where every word is a weapon. Elegant, refined, with black hair and hazel eyes, she weaves her plans in the shadows to keep control over what she believes is hers.</p>
</div>

<div class="character-block">
    <h2>Claudia Rufa Celtica</h2>
    <p>Valerio’s sister, rebellious philosopher and adventurer. Born in Lugdunum, but suffocated by Roman society’s constraints, she seeks freedom far from Rome—among soldiers and danger. Charismatic and alluring, with brown hair and grey eyes, she dances with fate unafraid and lives life unchained.</p>
